# convert audio to base64 README

While developing, sometimes we need the base64 version of the audio file. We go to various unreliable sites, upload the audio file and convert it to base64. You will now be able to reliably get the base64 version of your audio file with this tool.

## Release Notes

In the first use version, you can convert audio files very efficiently.

### 1.1.4

active release of 1.1.4
